# LDL-T-Decomposition
Project for "Numerical Linear Algebra" course - LDL^T Decomposition

For symmetric matrix A whose leading principal submatrices are nonsingular, we have unit lower-triangular matrix L and diagonal matrix D that A = LDL^T.
Matrices L and D can be easily computed using LU decomposition.
